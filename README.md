# OOP-Game

:game_die: This is the famous word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." 

I've used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. 

How does the game work?<br/>
A player tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard. 
Can they guess the phrase before they run out of attempts? :boom:
